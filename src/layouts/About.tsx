          My name is Cikal Gemintang Seya, Iâ€™m currently an undergraduate in
          National Institute of Technology, Bandung. Online, I usually go by
          sglkc or seya.
          Technology is what I have in mind ever since I was a child, my
          curiosity in elementary school was a big turning point, leading me
          to strive to be a programmer. Formally developed my skills
          vocational high school as a software engineer, I was caught into
          web development and I loved it.
