          Technology is what I have in mind ever since I was a child, my
          curiosity in elementary school was a big turning point, leading me
          to strive to be a programmer. As I formally develop my skills in
          vocational high school as a software engineer, I was caught into
          web development and I loved it so much.

          I usually work alone, but that doesn't mean I can't work with a team.
          Getting tasks right won't be possible without teamwork. I normally
          contribute to the team by giving recommendations and ideas with my
          own reasons.
